# Statistical and Machine Learning
## Author: Kolton Cox

This repository presents a few of the components I have learned in my machine learning class taught by Dr. Randy Davila at University of Houston - Downtown for the semester of Spring 2021. 

A supervised machine learning algorithm is one that relies on labeled input data to learn a function that produces an appropriate output when given new unlabeled data.

An unsupervised machine learning algorithm makes use of input data without any labels â€” in other words, no teacher (label) telling the child (computer) when it is right or when it has made a mistake so that it can self-correct.

Unlike supervised learning that tries to learn a function that will allow us to make predictions given some new unlabeled data, unsupervised learning tries to learn the basic structure of the data to give us more insight into the data.

### Projects:
The following topics are covered in this repository as part of the learning environment:

Using Julia
- Soon to come.

Using Python
- Soon to come.

### Course Description: 
This senior level data science course blends the predictive perspective of statistical pattern recognition together with the algorithmic perspectives of  machine learning. Topics include,  but  are  not  limited  to: 

**The Components of Learning**
 - Supervised Learning
 - Unsupervised Learning
 - Semisupervised Learning
 - Feasibility of Learning
 - Measuring Error
 
 ## Programming Languages 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) versions 3.6 and higher 
- [Julia](https://julialang.org/) versions 1.0 and higher
